                I grew up skiing and it has given me many injuries.  I spent some time in academia and discovered an amoeba in a 
                volcano, for which I was awarded a Masters degree, which you can <a href="https://scholarworks.calstate.edu/downloads/dn39x2060" target="_blank">Download Here (PDF)</a>  
                Previously I was working with boats, where I taught people how to navigate the 
                tumultuous seas of Southern California and Mexico.  I try and surf when I can, and play with my dog, <a href="./eisley.html" target="_blank">Eisley.</a>

             <p>The biology of extreme environments has focused 
                on diversity and adaptations, largely concentrating on the prokaryotic 
                community. Only recently have investigations targeted eukaryotic diversity 
                in extreme environments, and few studies have examined food web interactions.
                 I studied the protist grazing component of the Boiling
                  Springs Lake (BSL) food web. Boiling Springs Lake is a flooded fumarole 
          that contains a 1.8 ha pool of pH 2.2, 52°C water in California’s Lassen
          Volcanic National Park. It is an NSF-funded Microbial Observatory focused
           on understanding the diversity and interactions of the entire microbial
             community. Using a combination of culture and genetic approaches, I found
             the major predator in BSL to be a unique vahlkampfiid amoeba capable of
               surviving the physical extremes of BSL. It is closely related via rRNA
                sequence to Tetramitus thermacidophilus, a heterolobose
                 amoeboflagellate recently isolated from volcanic geothermal acidic 
             sites in Europe and Russia, and an uncultured heterolobosean amoebae from 
             the nearby Iron Mountain Mine acid mine drainage site. Transects studies
              showed the organism is endemic to the lake, and cysts were present at an 
              average of ~500 viable cells mg-1 on the shoreline. The amoeba form is
               active up to 52°C, is a strict acidophile, and was observed grazing on
                native ascomycete Phialophora sp., as well as bacteria such as Micrococcus
                 sp. Other grazing protists were identified in lakeshore environments, but 
                 were unable to grow in the extreme conditions of the lake. These include
                  the lobose amoebae Hartmannella sp. and Acanthamoeba sp., and the 
                  kinetoplastid flagellate Bodo sp. Acanthamoeba and Bodo were acid 
                  tolerant, but could not grow at temperatures above 30°C, while
                   Hartmentalla was thermotolerant but could not grow at low pH.
                    Microscopic analysis showed the presence of a variety of other
                     morphotypes that I tentatively identified as ciliates, euglenids,
                      cercozoans, and various flagellates from colder areas around the
                       lake. However, I was not able to culture these, and no genetic
                       identification was obtained. Additionally, I observed apparent 
                       large DNA viruses in Acanthamoeba sp. cultures, which resembled
                        Mimivirus. While still tentative, this is possibly the first 
                        observation of a eukaryotic virus from an acidothermal
                         environment.</font></p>

        <h1>Research Topics</h1>
        <p>We studied the protist grazers of Boiling Springs Lake (BSL), an acid 
            geothermal feature in Lassen Volcanic National Park, using a combination
             of culture and genetic approaches. The major predator in BSL is a 
             vahlkampfiid ameba closely related (95% 18S+ITS rRNA identity) to 
             Tetramitus thermacidophilus, a heterolobose ameboflagellate recently 
             isolated from volcanic geothermal acidic sites in Europe and Russia,
              as well as an uncultured heterolobosean from the nearby Iron Mountain
               acid mine drainage site. Tetramitus thermacidophilus strain BSL is 
               capable of surviving the physical extremes of BSL, with optimal growth
                at 38–50 °C and pH 2–5. This bacterivore also ingested conidiospores
            of the ascomycete Phialophora sp., but ultrastructural observations 
            reveal the latter may not be readily digested, and conidia were not 
            separable from the ameoboflagellate culture, suggesting a possible 
             symbiosis. DGGE fingerprint transects studies showed the organism 
            is restricted to near-lake environs, and we detected an average of
            ~500 viable cysts/cm3 sediment on the shoreline. Other grazing 
            protists were isolated from lakeshore environments, including the 
            lobose amebae Acanthamoeba sp. and Hartmannella sp., and the 
            kinetoplastid flagellate Bodo sp., but none could tolerate both 
            low pH and high temperature. These appear to be restricted to 
            cooler near lake geothermal features, which also contain other
         potential grazer morphotypes observed but not successfully cultured,
          including ciliates, euglenids, testate amebae, and possible cercozoans.
           We compare the food web of BSL with other acidic or geothermal sites,
            and discuss the impact of protists in this unique environment.</p>
